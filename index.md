## Recent Experience
### [PlanSource](https://plansource.com)
> **EDI Analyst** -- *2019-Present* At PlanSource I build and manage healthcare insurance eligibility file feeds sent to leading insurance carriers. Most integrations use the industry standard ANSI 834A 5010 format and are transmitted over SFTP. Sometimes PGP encryption is also used. My work orders are tracked and managed in Salesforce.

### [Conservice](https://www.conservice.com)
> **EDE/EDI Setup Processor** -- *2018-2019* As an electronic data interchange specialist I gathered information about client systems and software then determined how to integrate them with our process. Typically this involved setting up automated queries of a common industry standard softwares REST API's though I also set up integrations using other protocols such as SFTP and FTPS.

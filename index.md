Welcome to my home on the web. **This page is dedicated to my professional work**. If you are looking for my personal pages, head over [here](/personal).

## About Me
A Salt Lake City based Cybersecurity professional, I love learning about, working with, and hacking on computers. I'm fascinated by all things cybersecurity. I'm passionate about free and open source software. You can contact me at [email](mailto:jason@jasonrbrown.dev) or through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-brown-a1a964138/).

## Recent Experience
### [Castle & Cooke Mortgage](https://castlecookemortgage.com)
> **IT Security Administrator** -- *2023-Present* I'm now primarily involved in managing and running our IT security program. I maintain our written information security program documents and policies and procedures, and work with regulators and auditors to provide documentation of security controls in place. I perform user security awareness training, phishing susceptibility assessments, and respond to suspected and reported phishing emails. I also manage our Tenable vulnerability management suite, performing regular scans, tracking and remediating known vulnerabilities. I manage our CrowdStrike products, mainly MDR and their SIEM offering. Through the CrowdStrike next-gen SIEM, I monitor and respond to alerts from all of our security solutions including our network IDS, email gateway, EDR software, vulnerability scans, IDP logs, and Microsoft 365.

> **Systems Administrator** -- *2022-2023* A little of everything! VSphere administration, managing Nimble storage appliances, Windows and Linux server administration, backup management with Veeam, and of course, acting as our resident PowerShell guy. I performed regular work to improve the security of all this infrastructure, such as routine patching. I designed and enforced software and file ACL's through Active Directory.

> **IT Support Technician** -- *2021-2022* My responsibilities included resolving user tickets, installing hardware, imaging devices, managing physical access control systems, Active Directory user administration, Exchange server administration, software license provisioning, and VOIP system administration.

### [PlanSource](https://plansource.com)
> **EDI Analyst** -- *2019-2020* At PlanSource I built and managed healthcare insurance eligibility file feeds sent to leading insurance carriers. Most integration's used the industry standard ANSI 834A 5010 format and were transmitted over SFTP. Sometimes PGP encryption was also used. My work orders were tracked and managed in Salesforce.

Welcome to my home on the web. **This page is dedicated to my professional work**. If you are looking for my personal pages, head over [here](/personal).

## About Me
I'm a Salt Lake City based IT professional and Cybersecurity student. I love learning about, working with, and hacking on computers. I'm fascinated by all things cybersecurity. I'm passionate about free and open source software. I can be contacted by [email](mailto:jason@jasonrbrown.dev) or through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-brown-a1a964138/).

## Recent Experience
### [Castle & Cooke Mortgage](https://castlecookemortgage.com)
> **Systems Administrator** -- *2022-Present* A little of everything, though since the beginning of 2023 much of my time has shifted to a cybersecurity focus. vSphere administration, managing Nimble storage appliances, Windows and Linux server administration, backup management with Veeam, and of course, I'm still our resident PowerShell guy. I perform regular work to improve the security of all this infrastructure, along with routine patching and tracking of known vulnerabilities. I also perform our Meraki network administration with an emphasis on network security and running the IDS, firewall, and content filtering on the security appliances. Furthermore, I monitor and respond to alerts from all of our security solutions, including the IDS, email security gateway, SIEM, EDR software, Nessus vulnerability scans, and Microsoft 365. I also administer the physical access control software, along with designing and enforcing software and file ACL's through Active Directory.

> **IT Support Technician** -- *2021-2022* My responsibilities included resolving user tickets, installing hardware, imaging devices, managing physical access control systems, Active Directory user administration, Exchange server administration, software license provisioning, and VOIP system administration.

### [PlanSource](https://plansource.com)
> **EDI Analyst** -- *2019-2020* At PlanSource I built and managed healthcare insurance eligibility file feeds sent to leading insurance carriers. Most integration's used the industry standard ANSI 834A 5010 format and were transmitted over SFTP. Sometimes PGP encryption was also used. My work orders were tracked and managed in Salesforce.

# Lightly Herbed Dinner Rolls
*Author: Jason Brown*

### Ingredients
* Dough
    * 900g All purpose flour
    * 100g Whole wheat flour
    * 110g sugar
    * 22g salt
    * 3 tsp yeast
    * 2 large eggs
    * 240g warm water
    * 240g milk
    * 2 sticks butter, cubed
    * 1 tsp dried thyme
    * 1 tsp rubbed sage
* Rosemary Butter
    * 1 rosemary sprig
    * 1 stick butter

### Equipment
* Stand Mixer with dough hook

### Steps
1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast and mix on low speed to combine.
2. With the mixer running on low speed, add the egg, water, and milk. Slowly add the cubed butter, a few cubes at a time, and continue mixing for five minutes, or until all of the butter is incorporated. Fold in the thyme and sage.
3. Remove the dough from the bowl and gently knead with your hands for about 1 minute. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let sit for 45 minutes.
4. Take the dough out of the bowl and divide into 24 equal balls (about 50 g each). Take each ball and place in the palm of your hand and round them on the counter to create skin tension.
5. Coat a 10-inch cake pan or a 10-inch cast-iron skillet with cooking spray. Place the balls in the pan or skillet, spacing them about 1/4 inches apart. They should fit snugly into the pan and will bake into each other; you can tear or slice them apart after baking.
6. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let sit in a warmer part of your kitchen for one hour to proof. Donâ€™t let the plastic wrap touch the dough or it will stick when you remove it.
7. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Bake for 24-28 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through baking, until golden brown.
8. Meanwhile, to make the rosemary butter, in a small microwavable bowl or in a small saucepan with the rosemary sprig, melt the 1/4 cup of butter.
9. Remove the rolls from the oven and brush with the rosemary-infused melted butter while still hot.
10. Let cool for 10 minutes and serve warm. Or cool completely, cover with plastic wrap, and serve the next day. 

### My Notes
* Makes 24 rolls
* Use less sugar next time.
* The rolls can be frozen for up to three months in a resealable plastic bag or an airtight container.
* Rewarm frozen rolls in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes, brush the tops with about a teaspoon butter each while warm, and serve. Once the rolls are reheated, they are best eaten that day.

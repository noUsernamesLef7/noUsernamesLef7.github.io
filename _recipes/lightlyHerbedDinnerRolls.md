title: Lightly Herbed Dinner Rolls

  - Bread
ingredients:
  - 900g All purpose flour
  - 100g Whole wheat flour
  - 110g sugar
  - 22g salt
  - 3 tsp yeast
  - 2 large eggs
  - 240g warm water
  - 240g milk
  - 2 sticks butter, cubed
  - 1 tsp dried thyme
  - 1 tsp rubbed sage
  - 1 rosemary sprig
  - 1 stick butter
steps:
  - In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast and mix on low speed to combine.
  - With the mixer running on low speed, add the egg, water, and milk. Slowly add the cubed butter, a few cubes at a time, and continue mixing for five minutes, or until all of the butter is incorporated. Fold in the thyme and sage.
  - Remove the dough from the bowl and gently knead with your hands for about 1 minute. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let sit for 45 minutes.
  - Take the dough out of the bowl and divide into 24 equal balls (about 50 g each). Take each ball and place in the palm of your hand and round them on the counter to create skin tension.
  - Coat a 10-inch cake pan or a 10-inch cast-iron skillet with cooking spray. Place the balls in the pan or skillet, spacing them about 1/4 inches apart. They should fit snugly into the pan and will bake into each other; you can tear or slice them apart after baking.
  - Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let sit in a warmer part of your kitchen for one hour to proof. Donâ€™t let the plastic wrap touch the dough or it will stick when you remove it.
  - Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Bake for 24-28 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through baking, until golden brown.
  - Meanwhile, to make the rosemary butter, in a small microwavable bowl or in a small saucepan with the rosemary sprig, melt the 1/4 cup of butter.
  - Remove the rolls from the oven and brush with the rosemary-infused melted butter while still hot.
  - Let cool for 10 minutes and serve warm. Or cool completely, cover with plastic wrap, and serve the next day.

### Equipment
* Stand Mixer with dough hook

### My Notes
* Makes 24 rolls
* Use less sugar next time.
* The rolls can be frozen for up to three months in a resealable plastic bag or an airtight container.
* Rewarm frozen rolls in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes, brush the tops with about a teaspoon butter each while warm, and serve. Once the rolls are reheated, they are best eaten that day.

# Greengage Leather
_Author: Jason Brown_

### Ingredients
* 5 lbs Greengages (Green Plums)

### Steps
1. Slice plums in half, place on a baking sheet with the cut side facing up.
2. Bake in oven at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes, taking care not to burn them.
3. Remove plums from oven and allow to cool. Remove the stones.
4. Place fruit in blender and process until smooth and skin is in small pieces.
5. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and pour mixture evenly onto both sheets.
6. Use a spatula to smooth out the mixture making sure it's even.
7. Set oven to lowest setting and place sheets on middle racks. Keep the door open to help keep the temperature low.
8. Dry in oven for 7-9 hours. The fruit should be sticky to the touch but not squishy.
9. Remove from oven and cool, then roll the entire sheet and slice into strips.

### Author's Notes
A dehydrator would make the drying stage much easier.

ingredients:
  - 5 lbs Greengages (Green Plums)
steps:
  - Slice plums in half, place on a baking sheet with the cut side facing up.
  - Bake in oven at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes, taking care not to burn them.
  - Remove plums from oven and allow to cool. Remove the stones.
  - Place fruit in blender and process until smooth and skin is in small pieces.
  - Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and pour mixture evenly onto both sheets.
  - Use a spatula to smooth out the mixture making sure it's even.
  - Set oven to lowest setting and place sheets on middle racks. Keep the door open to help keep the temperature low.
  - Dry in oven for 7-9 hours. The fruit should be sticky to the touch but not squishy.
  - Remove from oven and cool, then roll the entire sheet and slice into strips.

### Author's Notes
A dehydrator would make the drying stage much easier.

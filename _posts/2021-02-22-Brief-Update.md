title: Brief Update
---
I don't have a real post for this week as I'm working on getting my new blog on physical security up and running. I have however recently added two new sections to my personal web pages here. A section on my personal [reading](/personal/books) and a collection of my thoughts on [movies](/personal/movies) I've seen. I'll be adding to them over time as I fill in what's already listed and add new entries.

title: March 2022 Link Roundup
---
Some of my favorite posts on blogs I follow are the occasional collections of interesting links the author has found recently. They usually consist of interesting articles, weird or unique internet sites, useful services, or blog recommendations. Being one of my favorite types of post, it seems only natural that I should also create a periodic roundup post on my blog. I already have a [link garden](/personal/link-garden.html) that I maintain on the site so I think when I make updates to that, I'll include them here with a rationale. So here it is, the highlights of my scrolling, reading, and surfing the last month or so.

## Articles

### New Growth in the Link Garden
[Three Angles on Erik Hoel's Aristocratic Tutoring](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2022/03/20/three-angles-on-erik-hoels-aristocratic-tutoring/) Explores an alternate educational model for children that if we could bring it back out of history and make it accessible could hold great promise. I disagree with the author that the tutoring of this nature wouldn't necessarily be "aristocratic" in nature. This sort of one on one attention wouldn't be affordable for the majority of people. They also suggest that larger family sizes could naturally push children to more advanced concepts, but I think this could also be done with just parental intervention.

[Bomb Alarm System](https://computer.rip/2022-04-01-Bomb-Alarm-System.html) A short and fairly technical history of a cold war alarm system to warn the United States nuclear forces when nuclear detonations occur in population centers. A fascinating pre-internet network based on Western Union telegraph infrastructure. I was interested to learn that one of the Master Control Centers was in fact located in Salt Lake City, Utah. Living in the Salt Lake Metro area, I am keen to find out where this facility was located and if the building still exist. I've done a bit of digging on the internet, even emailed the author of the linked post to see if they had any more info, but so far have been unable to locate it. I have not yet exhausted hope that it can be located and will write it up here once I do find it.

[Hard to work with.](https://lethain.com/hard-to-work-with/) An interesting take on calibrating your expectations to match those of your employer, and the problems that can arise if you maintain expectations that are too high. *"I’ve seen a staggering number of folks fail in an organization primarily because they want to hold others to a higher standard than their organization’s management is willing to enforce."*

That's probably enough for now. I'm thinking about making this a maybe once a month affair, so now that it's in the back of my mind I can mentally sort things to add here next time.

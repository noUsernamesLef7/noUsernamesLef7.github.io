title: Welcome Jaxon!

---
My first child was born this month. His name is Jaxon. He's a cool little dude; alert, easygoing, and quick to comfort. So far I'm loving being a father. I've taken a month off from work to get to know him and take care of him and it's been one of the most rewarding investments I've ever made.

Welcome to the world little Jax! I can't wait to help you grow and learn!

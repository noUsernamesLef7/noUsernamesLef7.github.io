## About This Site
This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

### Hosting
Currently hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) as it's free and plays quite nicely with Jekyll. I've set up a custom domain, rather than using the [provided one](https://nousernameslef7.github.io).

### Theme
The sites color scheme is inspired by JetBrains Darcula (not to be confused with [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com)) color scheme, implemented in CSS by yours truly.

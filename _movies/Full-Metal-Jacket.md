I felt like continuing on my Kubrick streak and felt like watching a war movie so I gave this classic a try. I liked the format, almost two separate movies in one. I liked the scene that was shot as a series of interviews with individual soldiers, seeing the varying views and opinions on the war and killing. I feel a great self summary of the movie was the scene were Joker is questioned by a disapproving colonel on why he has a peace sign on his uniform and the words "Born to kill" on his helmet.

*Pvt. Joker: "I think I was trying to suggest something about the duality of man, sir."*

*Colonel: "The what?"*

*Pvt. Joker: "The duality of man. The Jungian thing, sir."*

Terrible. I wanted to turn it off after only ten minutes of suffering at the hands of Adam Sandler but my wife insisted "It has to get better, right?" We ended up wasting about 45 minutes of our lives waiting for this godawful movie to get funny but it never did. I literally laughed only once in the entire time I spent watching it.

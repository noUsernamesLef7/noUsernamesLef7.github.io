A few of my favorites stories about what may have happened in the late 20th century had cooler heads not prevailed. I also include a couple of stories that aren't strictly Cold War turned hot scenarios.

1. *Red Storm Rising* by Tom Clancy (And Larry Bond)
2. *The Third World War* by Sir General John Hackett, et al.
3. *Team Yankee* by Harold Coyle
4. *Cauldron* by Larry Bond
5. *Vortex* by Larry Bond
6. *Red Phoenix* by Larry Bond
7. *World War 1990* by William Stroock

A few groupings of my favorite books on specific topics or genres, as well as a list of all the books I've read this year.

I like many others have recently come to the realization that I no longer read books. I noticed this in 2019 when it was nearly October and I couldn't recall a single book that I'd read all year. I decided to change that in 2020 and found that it was actually somewhat difficult to get back into. My attention wandered and I had difficulty finding the time, it's almost like I had to re-learn how to read a book. I actually did read a book entitled *How to Read a Book by Mortimer Adler* in an attempt to recover this seemingly lost talent. My efforts that year were acceptable I suppose but 2021 is off to a great start. February is not yet over at the time of this writing and I've already read seven books, more than all of 2019.

## 2021
* *Fox Tossing: and Other Forgotten and Dangerous Sports, Pastimes, and Games* by Edward Brooke-Hitching
	* Highly entertaining read. I love this style of british humor.
* *On Liberty* by Jon Stuart Mill
	* Lots of depth here. Deserves a second, more analytical reading.
* *Deep Work* by Cal Newport
	* Been working to implement some of the ideas. I plan to give it some time and then re-read it to harvest more ideas.
* *How to Become a Straight-A Student* by Cal Newport
	* This book is slightly dated and begging for a second edition. Much of it is not suited for my own circumstance of online school and working full-time but the core ideas remain solid. Quality work produced = time spent * intensity of focus.
* *The Shallows* by Nicholas Carr
	* A bit meandering, a bit hopeless. The author has few practical suggestions for avoiding the problems he highlights.
* *Fair Play* by Eve Rodsky
	* A proposed system for dividing household labor. I especially like the idea of each person being solely responsible for what's on their plate from conception, through planning, and on to execution. No need to remind each other to get started on something.

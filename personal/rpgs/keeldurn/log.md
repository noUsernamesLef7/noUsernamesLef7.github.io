## The Rebooted Adventure

### Session 6
**2025-03-19**
* The crushrooms shamble into action and the ready party meets them
* Billy draws courage from his karate training and shouts "Ignite the spirit within!" while lighting a torch and charging in to attack
	* He attacks with his signature "inferno punch!", thrusting the blazing torch at the monster and missing badly
	* The monster then raises it's long fibrous tendrils and lunges to grab hold of him
* Yui courageously dives in front of Billy and is entangled in the tentacles rather than him
	* Yui struggles as the monster raises her above it's head and tries to maneuver her into the awaiting maw
	* The rest of the party frantically begins hacking and slashing at the monster
	* Yui manages to wriggle just enough that only her right arm is forced into the opening in the mushroom cap
	* Colin sidesteps the second crushroom as it lumbers toward him and unleashes a flurry of slashes with his glaive on the creature holding Yui
	* Just as the monster begins to constrict and the pain begins to build in Yui's arm, it goes limp and falls to the floor sending her sprawling
* Colin unfortunately has stuck his neck out for Yui a bit too far
	* The second crushroom grabs him as he is focused on his attack and stuffs him into it's mouth-like opening up to his chest
	* The rest of the vanguard, including the quickly recovered Yui, rush to his aid
	* They slice, slash, and chop at the fungal fibers but to no avail as it begins squeezing in on him.
		* Even Chrissy and Ovouster lend aid in hacking apart the beast
	* They do tremendous damage leaving great rends in the stalk and cap, but it continues to crush
	* Colin is clearly having the life squeezed out of him as his armor distorts and bones break
	* It appears he is all but dead as he gurgles, blood drips from the corners of his mouth, and foams pink around his nostrils
* At what seems the last possible moment, the monster has been slashed up so thoroughly there is no longer enough structure to support it and it collapses
* Everyone rushes to see what can be done to save Colin
* Father Esser, aided by Yui, performs a miraculous feat of first aid and manages to tie off Colins legs before he can die of arterial bleeding
	* He then double barrel shotguns two jars of paut and casts Healing Slumber on Colin
* Billy agrees to quench the flames from within for now and apologizes to Yui for forcing her to almost sacrifice her life
* Father Esser improvises a stretcher
* Yui telekinetically carries the stretcher back to the base camp
* The party spends two hours at camp
	* Royce pours a major healing potion down Colins throat
	* Further first aid is carried out
* Father Esser attempts another major healing and succeeds

### Session 5
**2025-03-05**
* Tymmy returns Old Man Lews mushrooms, pretending to retrieve them from Yui's pack.
* Father Esser finds a potion missing from his backpack and determines that a scroll contained within hungers for items
* The party set out to explore the mushroom farming tunnel
* The party cautiously enters the dining hall and examined the signs of previous camps.
	* They speculated about what kind of creatures may have been here.
	* Suspects include Goblins and Kobolds
    * Notable graffiti on the table surfaces included:
        * "Gobton boys here"
        * "Kregg Krew"
        * "Crushroom taste bad"
        * "Kleebles died here" next to a dark stain on the stone
* The party heard some odd sounds coming from the direction of the workshops, so decided to investigate there first.
* Tymmy scouted ahead and identified the tool storage room along with the machinery room
    * Exploring the machinery room and with some help from the Dwarven cultural consultant, the party located two control ports for the machine operating here
    * Rotating the top keyhole fully left caused the pitch of the operating machine to slow, and then lurch to a stop.
    * After shutting down the machine, the party opened the access panel and inspected the compartment inside, finding a metal shaft with a flat disc at either end concealing the rest of the machine.
* Tymmy finds a large silver coin and a ring in the well
    * The coin was given to colin as a gesture of good will, "because he's nice"
* The party exited the machine room and noted that the sounds of water trickling down the stairs had stopped.
* The party returned to the tool storage room
    * Father Esser was examining the pile of tools in the middle of the room when a swarm of leeches lept from the water
    * One latched to his face, two on his hand
    * The party scrambles to aid him as he attempts to pluck the leeches from his body
    * Yui telekinetically crushes the one on his face
    * Esser smashes one on his hand, and it sprays his blood into the air getting into Yui's eyes
    * Colin grasps the last one and rips it free (liberating a small chunk of skin with it) then crushes it, carefully shielding it as it pops
* The group continues on into the massive growing chambers
* They investigate and taste the pale yellow mushrooms here and observe the glittering gold spores.
* Moving on to a second chamber to the west and lured in by a bioluminescent glow, they find blue glowing mushrooms
    * Yui peeks into the room and attempts to telekinetically grab a mushroom
    * Upon plucking it, the mushroom bursts and causes the other mushrooms from its patch to also burst
    * Yui is blasted with glowing spores
* Tymmy placed a trap in the South passage between chamber 1 and 2.
* The party advanced along the length of this chamber
* A giant, child-sized rat was spotted wandering ahead of them.
    * Tymmy took careful aim with his crossbow and fired a bolt directly through the rats brain killing it instantly
* At the far end of the chamber, the party took a passage back into what they suspected was the far end of the first chamber
* Here, they elected to use the upward stairs to hopefully get free of the water for a time
    * Finding it dark at the top, Billy led forward to illuminate the chamber
    * The party found it to be full of enormous, person-sized mushrooms
    * Tymmy, feeling suspicious, sinks a crossbow bolt into a random mushroom to see if it reacts
    * It doesn't. Two other nearby stalks of fungal fruit however, do react, and begin to turn and shuffle towards the party!

### Session 4
**2025-02-25**
* The party searched the last two rooms in the southernmost section of the dungeon, avoiding the spike pit.
    * Royce found a wand that turned out to be an aid to necromantic spellcasting
    * Father Esser is not amused.
* The group then backtracked to last unexplored room, the one with a stream flowing through it.
* Colin opened a sarcophagi and a flying skull zipped out and chomped his arm
* The skull then swooped across the room, diving at Yui.
    * A mummified dwarf zombie was also inside, wielding a great axe
* Yui dealt a psychic punch as it flew, and Royce was able to swat it out of the air with his shield as it passed him.
* Yui punched the dwarf so hard the reanimation failed and it collapsed.
* The party was able to safely trigger an entrapment trap and discover a shortcut back to the beginning of the dungeon.
* With the crypt now fully explored, the party returned to base camp and sent the porters to recover the treasure.
* While the hauling progressed, Father Esser appealed to Sarenrae who revealed to him the magical nature of several items
* Yui continued training Billy in the finer points of Karate. The results of this training may not be what you'd expect... (Teaching critical failure)
* Father Esser while seeking solitude, stumbled upon Tymmy the stowaway thief in an unused room in the base camp building.
* Tymmy is introduced to the party, and causes significant mischief.
    * Tymmy steals Esser's rations from his pack
    * He also snags Old Man Lew's mushroom pouch and hides it amongst Yui's belongings.
* After relaxing for the "evening," the group enjoys a refreshing nights sleep.
* They start the day fresh and ready to follow up on the next of their leads.

### Session 3
**2025-02-05**
* Moved from running the game in Tabletop Simulator to Foundry w/Gurps 4e unofficial module.
* Colin and Yui return from the base camp and rejoin the party.
* The group proceeds cautiously, wary for more traps.
* A few minor treasures are collected, mainly by Father Esser who proves to have a knack for sniffing out treasure. Notably:
    * A clay tablet, with inscription
    * A scroll with magenta writing
* Yui finds a rapier hidden in a coffin, that seems to have an excited energy about it.
* Father Esser spots a spear trap and it is successfully triggered to render it harmless.
* Coming upon a locked door and unsuccessfully attempting to batter it down, it is instead decided to burn through it.
* This burning is repeated on the next locked door.
* The next door is sadly inflammable stone.
* Fortunately, Royce came prepared. He pulls out his dwarven pickaxe and cuts a slot in the edge of the door big enough for a prybar to find purchase.
* It takes the entire parties combined strength prying on the crowbar to break apart the heavy bar on the far side of the door and admit them into a room filled with glistening treasures!
* It was revealed to Father Esser by his god that the room contained some object which seemed to be emitting a projectile capture field, that would reverse the momentum of any projectile in the room.
* He was also able to discern that the sarcophagi in the room containing a corpse had traces of a final rest spell, preserving the body.
* The party continued on, spotting and bypassing more traps.
* Exploring more dark corridors, the party came upon a room guarded by skeleton archers and a huge puddle of dissolved corpses.
* The slime in the puddle suddenly inflated, knocking back several members of the party and injuring some.
* Colin rushed in and singlehandedly destroyed both skeletons.
* Yui opted for a strategy of hurling various concotions at the slime after finding that physical attacks didn't seem to be getting anywhere fast. A black potion was thrown in and sank with no apparent affect.
* Next, a bottle of alchemists fire was smashed next to the puddle, and flowing over the surface of the slime burned much of it away.
* She decided to continue on this track and dumped a good quantity of lamp oil over the surface of it to continue fueling the flames.
* Two bottles of lamp oil later, the slime had been mostly evaporated and was reduced to a rubbery solid in the bottom of its hole.

### Session 2
**2025-01-29**
* The party began by taking a 90 minutes rest after their encounter with the Flame Lord.
* After resting, they climbed the stairs back up to the Nobles Quarters.
* Standing once more in the throne room, the party became highly suspicious of the skulls decorating the room and proceeded to pile them on the floor, with Royce crushing them to shards and dust.
* The group opened the sealed door marked "Undead" and entered the crypt.
* Immediately upon entering, the characters were assailed by the patient skeleton guards inside.
* The party worked together and managed to destroy the five skeletons.
* Father Esser found a burlap sack of assorted treasures and two of note:
    * A green vial
    * A silvery scroll
* Gwynedd in the combat, managed to snag a thrown black potion out of the air and gave it to Yui for safekeeping.
* Tragically, this would be one of Gwynedd's last moments. Very soon after, he approached the table full of embalming tools and triggered a trap. Both he and Yui were in the path but Yui with her foxgirl ears managed to hear the spring mechanism triggering and managed to fly into the air just in time to avoid a large scythe swinging out from the wall under the table.
* The scythe caught Gwynedd in the left femur, splintering it and continuing on to do the same to the right. Now unsupported by his legs, the upper body fell to the floor and shattered into pieces. Gwynedd Ap Awain was no more, now just a broken pile of bones mixed in with broken remains of the skeletons slain moments earlier.
* Yui flew back to the basecamp to inform the crew and bring Colin as reinforcements for the Vanguard.

### Session 1
**2025-01-15**
* The party assembled and moved up the spiral staircases of the keep to reach the Flame Lords library.
* Once there, they attempted to extinguish him by dumping water on him and hurling water barrels at him.
* It did not work as they had hoped, and they broke into combat.
* The fighting went on for some time, with the party eventually realizing that despite dealing a large amount of damage, they were not making much progress.
* Royce moved to face the Flame Lord and extended his bare hand as an offering of truce.
* The Flame Lord considered this for a moment, then accepted, grabbing Royce's hand and shaking it vigorously dealing 2d6 burning damage as he did.
* With peace established, the party attempted to negotiate with the Flame Lord for access to the library or to borrow some books. He refused, so they instead pilfered an important looking book on their way out.
* The party returned to the base camp and gave the book to Old Man Lew to research.

## Original Adventure

### Session 1

**2022-07-14**
* Covered rules, player guidelines, GCS, Tabletop Simulator
* Read Intro
* Players described their characters
* At the party outside Jorave's House:
	* Godwin conversed with Jorave, learned that the last thing to break forth from the hole was a goblin raiding party. That was nigh upon five years ago now. He also spoke about the in-fighting among the Thorn Tribe dwarves that live inside the mountain.
	* Father Esser spoke to Old Man Lew, asked him if he knew what traps or dangers might lurk in the mountain. Old man Lew could only speculate. It's clear that his expertise is in the historical state of the mountain, not so much the current state.
	* Winnoa pick pocketed some dried mushrooms from Old Man Lew's pouch.
	* Father Esser witnessed this and was able to bite his tongue and not immediately right the wrong for the sake of party unity and getting off on the right foot.
	* Hector was generally insufferable ;p
* The next day before descending, Godwin made a donation to the local temple, The Church of the Crimson Bridge
* The party descended into the dungeon
	* Godwin showed off by climbing down into the hole without even a rope.
	* The party noted the severed bell cord.
	* Godwin disregarded it, not worrying due to his exceptional climbing ability.
	* Royce alerted the people on the surface to the state of the rope and a new length was affixed to the bell and lowered into the hole.
* The party gathered in the circular room at the bottom of the shaft and inspected the remains of the adventurers who had met their end there.
	* The porters Emmett and Henry were ordered to clear aside the corpses and bone piles so that the room could be used as an initial base camp (Royce graciously assisted and profited, finding a gemstone in the hand of a corpse)
	* The corpses were place into the chests. Unfortunately for the party, one of the corpses was placed in the chest with the false bottom and the putrefied corpse goo has leaked into the hidden chamber and destroyed the scroll there.
* It was decided that the vanguard would scout out the area while the base camp waited in the entry way.
	* Chrissy the cartographer and Billy the torchbearer were brought along for the scouting.
	* The party took great delight in Billy's naivete and he would become significantly more deflated in the brief time he has spent underground with them so far
* The vanguard ventured down a hallway and encountered a puddle full of excitable large leaches that sprung from the puddle to attack Royce as he drew near
	* Several leaches latched onto Royce's exposed flesh and chewed away but the iron dwarf was unfazed.
	* He calmly picked them off and squished them, going back through the puddle several times for good measure to make sure they were all gone.
* The party continued down the hallway and entered into a chamber filled with stone houses.
	* There were signs of a massacre here, slaughtered dwarves skeletons lay strewn about and bore weapon marks.
	* Father Esser found a silver bracelet hidden under a dwarves skeleton
	* Godwin was first to spot the ragged hole in the cavern wall.
	* Hector was able to discern that the apparent forceful breach of the chamber wall was indeed the work of a powerful caster.
	* The party debated how or if to proceed and settled upon extinguishing all lights, and following along the left hand wall of the tunnel with Godwin leading

### Session 2
**2022-07-19**
* The party journeyed down the tunnel and emerged in the barracks cavern
	* The cavern was well searched but no loot was found.
	* Winnoa was first to observe the group of dead humans in their sleeping gear.
	* Royce spotted some movement in one of the holes along the back of the cavern.
* Godwin peeked ahead in the dining room and then the rest of the party followed there.
	* Royce ate some of the white musty powder from the kitchen. It tasted like moldy bread and there seemed to be no ill effects.
* The party moved on into the pottery workshop
	* While looting several of the larger pots, Winnoa and hector both spot two kobolds peeking at them from behind a cabinet
		* The kobolds run for it.
		* Royce throws a hatchet but just misses.
		* Hector takes a moment to aim his flintlock and fires, striking the rear kobold in the back.
		* The kobold stumbles and falls to his knees giving Godwin time to race up and crack his whip against the kobold, finishing him off.
		* The other kobold scurries off and is lost.
		* For good measure, Royce picks the dead kobold up by the head, shakes it around snapping it's neck, and tosses it aside.
* The group returns to the dining room and decides where to set up the base camp
	* It is decided that the base camp will be moved to this dining room as the multiple doors provide various escape routes
* The group ventures back to inform the base camp and assist in moving them
* They stop in the barracks cavern to peek at what Royce saw in the hole earlier
	* They spy a very large rat, gleaming eyes and large yellow teeth at the back of one of the holes
	* Hector stands a short ways away and fires his flintlock at the rat
	* Crit fail; misses, temporary "crippling" of shooting arm; firearm malfunctions; the gun has a mechanical failure and is unable to fire
	* Hector is able to quickly determine what is wrong with the gun but will need an hour or two to make repairs
* The party makes it's way back to the base camp
	* Chrissy finds that her prized compass is missing!
	* The combined party gathers up the equipment and provisions and walks back to the dining hall
* With the base camp now established in the dining room, the vanguard opts to venture down the spiral staircase
	* The group reaches the landing and is confronted by the ghost demanding their authorization paperwork
	* As a dwarf, he simply allows Royce to pass
	* The others talk to him briefly, asking if anyone else has passed
	* He lets them know about lots of kobolds and a few goblins carrying digging equipment
	* With this new information, the party attempts to simply walk past him
	* He responds by casting thunderclap; Everyone successfully avoids deafening
	* Father Esser casts effect spirits on Royce and he slaps the ghost.
	* The ghost looks absolutely shocked by this rebuke and dissolves away, at least for now
* The party walks down the meandering tunnel and reaches the room with the large portcullis
	* Royce attempts to brute force lift the portcullis before it is pointed out to him that it is locked
* The party opts to venture down the tunnel with the skull warning, but not before Royce smashes the skull on the ground
	* They quickly find the dead end and the dwarvish inscription on the wall
	* They poke around at the cave-in for a bit and make a determination that it would not be worth trying to excavate
	* Chrissy offers to make a rubbing of the inscription so that someone at the base camp can later decipher it
* The party walks back and heads down the other tunnel
	* They spot the green light ahead in an alcove; Godwin sneaks forward to scout it out
	* He's fortunate to catch the poor, foolish goblins unawares and deftly decapitates all three in their sleep
	* The group continues on down the tunnel and finds themselves at the entrance to another dining hall
	* Blocking the doorway is an armed and armored dwarf
	* Father Esser isn't certain but he thinks it may be a Draug
* The group discusses for a minute but since the dwarf doesn't seem to be able to or want to negotiate, they decide to fight their way past
	* Father Esser volunteers to attack first and begins to approach
	* The Draug interrupts with a held action and rushes forward to attack but is blocked by Father Esser
	* Full on fighting breaks out with the rest of the party charging in to fight
	* The Draug seems largely focused on Esser and swings at him a few more times, finally connecting with his torso and inflicting a heavy ax chop that fells Father Esser to the ground, unconscious, overwhelmed by pain and shock.
	* Royce moves to the defense of Father Esser, standing over his fallen form and bashing the raging dwarf back with his shield
	* Hector also lends aid, casting a healing spell on Esser to maintain his life
	* Blows are landed on the Draug by Godwin and Royce as the dwarf maneuvers back and forth through the fray
	* The Draug takes a swing at Godwin and gets lucky. A critical success lets him land a blow on the agile Godwin and he deals a whopping 18 point rend to Godwin's torso
	* Godwin's body gives out on him and he too succumbs to unconsciousness after failing a health roll.
	* Royce keeps bringing the fight to the Draug and with a single hand, chokes down on his long ax and brings it down on him, leaning forward over Godwin's still body
	* Winnoa also makes her way into the fray here, nimbly making her way around the Draug side and towards his back all while probing for weak points with her smallsword
	* The furious dwarf shows no mercy and brings his ax down on the unconscious Godwin, smashing into his face and mangling flesh and chipping bone
	* Godwin makes a HT roll to avoid dying and manages to do so, clinging to life despite his grievous wounds
	* Royce once more steps to stand over his wounded comrade, confronting the monstrous dwarf head on while Winnoa and Hector circle around the sides searching out weaknesses
	* Royce takes a risk and rushes in landing a hefty ax strike on the Draug ax arm that splinters the bone and slices the muscle and tendons away
	* The Draug ax clatters to the floor as it's crippled arm flops uselessly at the shoulder

### Session 3
**2022-07-28**
* The party finishes off the Draug in horrific fashion
	* Winnoa abandons her sword thrusts and leans in to bite the Draug in the neck, tearing away bloodless veins and sinews
	* Royce brings his ax down in a two handed swing right into the bite mark left by Winnoa and kills the Draug
* After defeating the Draug, the party began attending to the wounded to stabilize and treat them
	* Godwin was placed in a magical coma to allow him to be stable and heal quickly
* The party returned to their base camp and rested for 8 hours.
	* Rations were consumed
	* Godwin awakened near the end of the rest period, in terrible pain. His screams and shouts muffled by the bandages covering his face
	* Another 8 hour magical coma spell was cast on him
* the party brought the porters back down to the Draug village and cleared out the workshops of valuables
* On the return trip, Father Esser performed a 15 minute exorcism ritual on the bureaucrats ghost, banishing him from existence
* Upon unloading the loot, the party decided to venture down the hall to the dormitories
	* They heard an animal grunting or huffing down the hall, but instead of rushing to see what it was, they proceeded methodically
	* The group proceeded to quickly kick in every single door on both sides of the hall and clear every room, making tremendous noise
	* They found the dissected kobold corpses, and found the incision wounds on their chests
	* Rounding the corner, the group found the barricaded doorway, with more kobold corpses near it.
	* Royce cleared the barricade and ripped the door off it's hinges to reveal that the entryway was packed tightly with a huge amount of furniture
	* Royce lead the party around the corner and through the trapped hallway, bulldozing most of the traps out of the way
* Upon reaching a clearing in the debris and traps, an ambush was sprung with four kobolds leaping out of doorways and attacking
	* Billy was caught in a highly unfortunate position and was skewered by spears from both sides.
	* The spear to his right dug deep into his shoulder, severing tendons and causing him to drop the lantern
	* Royce dispatched the two at the front
	* father Esser, hector, and Winnoa took care of the two attacking billy
	* Winnoa did some more chomping
	* All the kobold ambushers appear to have been slain...

### Session 4
**2022-08-04**
* We picked up right after the party had slain the last of the four kobold ambushers.
	* A bit of looting was done, though they didn't carry much of interest.
	* Billy was stabilized, though his arm is still crippled until he reaches full health
	* Lucas arrived, having heard the sounds of battle and knowing that the party was down a member with Godwin injured
	* Hector was feeling a bit worn out from the battle, and retired to the camp with Billy
		* He sent Colin in his stead
* The party then continued on as they had before to the end of the hallway
* The group then entered the chapel
	* A brief search was conducted, and the rune on the altar was discovered.
	* The group asked Chrissy to take a rubbing on the rune and the moment she touched the altar, a black flash filled the air
	* Chrissy was surrounded by a dark, gloomy, aura for the next few hours
	* A rubbing is taking by Lucas using is telekinesis to manipulate the parchment and charcoal
* The group then entered the kobold warren
	* With Royce at the front, the party reached the glass embedded blanket blocking the tunnel.
	* Royce looked under it with his periscope and spotted the kobold klan arrayed on the other side in ambush
	* The group backed off, opting to wait about 3 hours to rest before engaging the kobolds
	* During this time, the murky aura surrounding Chrissy dissipated
* After their brief rest, the party gathered themselves to assault the kobold nest and formulated an entry plan
	* A runner was sent back to grab one of the bottles of Alchemists Fire possessed by Hector
	* It was decided that Royce would lead into the den, with shield cast on him by Father Esser, grab the blanket, yank it from the ceiling, throw it onto the kobolds, and follow it up with the alchemists fire
	* The kobolds were stunned by the ferocity of the onslaught and the bottle of Alchemists Fire turned the area into a raging circle of fire filled with burning and fleeing kobolds.
	* The kobolds guarding the entrance were mostly slaughtered where they stood, caught off guard and dazed by the roaring fire
	* A few escaped into the dark winding passages
	* The party pressed on, exploring the tunnels and confronting several traps, all the while being harassed by blowpipe wielding kobolds from around every corner and dark nook
	* The party reached an incubation chamber, filled with nests of kobold eggs. The lone guard and sole remaining Kobold of the klan, begged for mercy and was struck down.
	* The party briefly debated what to do and decided to stomp all of the kobold eggs and the little half developed kobolds inside
	* After a bit more exploration, the party located the kobold treasure horde!

### Session 5
* Brief encounter with the flame lord
* The rest of my notes are lost to time...
